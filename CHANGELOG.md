# Changelog

## [0.0.38]

### Added
- **[Experimental]** Web ticket form at `GET /ticket` — browser-based ticket submission with cascading dropdowns (group → topic → category → request type → priority), reporter name, message body, and optional Telegram message link; creates a Linear issue via the same path as the bot including on-duty assignment
- `/offboard` command — admin flow to remove a departed employee from all bot-managed groups; resolves `@username` to a user ID via the bot's metadata DB, checks membership in each approved group, then shows an inline keyboard to remove from groups one by one or all at once
- `/ticket` reply flow now captures caption text from media messages — previously, replying to a photo+caption message produced an empty ticket body; the caption is now used as the message body
- `/ticket` reply flow now extracts photo and document links from the replied message and includes them in the Linear issue description alongside the message text and source link

### Changed
- Port `8000` exposed in `docker-compose.yml` for the web server; configurable via `WEB_PORT` env var


## [0.0.37]

### Added
- `/users` detail view — tapping a user in the list opens an in-place detail view showing full name, Telegram username, and linked Linear account (or "not linked"), with Set Tag, Delete, and Back actions
- `/users` list shows 🔷 indicator next to users who have a Linear account linked
- `/start` now appears in the help output
- `/ticket` in an unconfigured topic now lists which topics in the same group do have support configured, so users know where to go

### Fixed
- `/users` detail view always showed "not linked" for Linear — `GetUserByID` was not selecting `linear_username`


## [0.0.36]

### Changed
- `/users` list — each user is now a single button; users with a linked Linear account show a 🔷 indicator
- Tapping a user opens a detail view (edited in-place) showing full name, Telegram username, and Linear account (or "not linked"), with Set Tag, Delete, and Back actions
- `/start` added to the command registry so it appears in the help output


## [0.0.35]

### Added
- Linear account linking — on first `/ticket` use, the bot asks the user for their Linear username and saves it against their Telegram user ID; subsequent uses skip the prompt
- `/mylinear` command — lets any user set or update their Linear username at any time; shows current value if already set
- DM access for group members — non-admin users can now DM the bot if they are a member of at least one approved group (checked via `getChatMember`); admin commands remain admin-only
- `/start` command — replaces `/help` as the bot entry point; Telegram shows it automatically as a button on first open
- `linear_username` column added to `telegram_user_metadata` (migration 007)
- `ListApprovedGroupIDs` storage method for membership checks

### Changed
- Text input during an active ticket session is now routed through the pending-session handler for both `FlowTicket` and `FlowSupport`


## [0.0.34]

### Changed
- `/support` and `/ticket` merged into a single `/ticket` command — if used as a reply, the replied-to message is used as the ticket source (immediate creation after category/type/priority); if used standalone, the full support flow runs (category → type → priority → title → description)
- `/support` command removed


## [0.0.33]

### Reverted
- `/support` ForceReply approach from 0.0.32 — reverted back to single-message `EditMessageText` flow; the ForceReply UX was disruptive in group chats


## [0.0.32]

### Fixed
- `/support` title and description steps now use `ForceReply` messages instead of `EditMessageText`; plain text replies from users in groups were never delivered to the bot when group privacy mode is enabled — only replies to bot messages are guaranteed to arrive regardless of privacy mode
- Group-level categories (scoped to a group but not a specific topic) were never returned by `ListCategoriesForContext`; the query now includes `chat_id = ? AND thread_id IS NULL` in both the no-topic and topic branches so group-level categories appear in `/support` for all users in that group


## [0.0.31]

### Added
- Clone category — tap 📋 Clone on any category in `/categories` to duplicate it to a different group/topic; choose target group, then scope (group-level or a specific topic), then keep the same Linear team key or enter a new one; the clone copies the category name, emoji, and all linked request types

### Fixed
- All `**markdown**` syntax removed from Telegram message strings; rule documented in CLAUDE.md — `ParseMode` must never be used in this codebase and markdown syntax renders as literal characters without it
- `msg.From == nil` nil panic on service messages and anonymous admin posts in `handleMessage`
- `/support` title step error now logged when `EditMessageText` fails silently


## [0.0.30]

### Changed
- `/addtype` — after selecting a category, existing request types are now shown as buttons; tap one to link it directly, or tap ✏️ New type to enter a custom name; eliminates duplicate creation and makes reuse of shared types explicit
- Group names are now loaded from DB on cache miss in `getGroupName` so pickers show correct names immediately after bot restart instead of raw IDs
- Group title is only written to DB when it changes (was written on every message); same change-detection pattern as user metadata


## [0.0.29]

### Fixed
- `/addtype` — `AddRequestType` returned a stale connection rowid when the type name already existed (SQLite's `LastInsertId()` after `INSERT OR IGNORE` returns the last rowid of any previous insert on the connection, not zero); always SELECT the id now, so linking an existing type name to a new category works correctly instead of failing with a FOREIGN KEY constraint error


## [0.0.28]

### Added
- Priority selection step in `/support` and `/ticket` flows — after request type (or category if no types), a priority keyboard is shown: 🔴 P0 — now, 🟠 P1 — today, 🟡 P2 — week, 🔵 P3 — later; maps to Linear priority values Urgent/High/Medium/Low and is passed in the `issueCreate` mutation


## [0.0.27]

### Changed
- `/addtype`, `/addperson`, `/setrotation` — category picker is now hierarchical: global categories shown at the top level; groups with scoped categories appear as navigation buttons; tapping a group shows group-level categories and any topics that have topic-level categories; ⬅️ Back navigates up the tree


## [0.0.26]

### Fixed
- `/addcategory` — `EditMessageText` calls that embedded user-provided strings (group name, topic name) with `ParseMode: Markdown` silently failed when names contained `_`, `*`, or `[`; removed `ParseMode` from all category-flow message edits so the UI always updates


## [0.0.25]

### Fixed
- `/addcategory` — stale Telegram callbacks (`confirm:global`, `topic:`) arriving after bot restart triggered `addCategoryNow` immediately with empty fields; handlers now only act when session is in the expected `StepAdminCatSelectTopic` step, ignoring out-of-sequence callbacks


## [0.0.24]

### Changed
- `/addcategory` flow — group and topic selection moved to the start: command now opens a group picker first, then a topic picker (if the group has registered topics), then proceeds to name → emoji → team key; context header (`🏘️ Group · 📌 Topic`) shown throughout all text-entry steps

### Fixed
- `/addcategory` — registered topics not shown when running the command from DM after a bot restart; `getAllTopics` now loads directly from DB instead of relying on the in-memory group cache
- Missing ❌ Cancel button in topic selection and topic-confirm keyboards


## [0.0.23]

### Added
- 🗑 Clear tag button next to each user in `/users` — skips label input, goes straight to group selection, and clears the tag via `setChatMemberTag` with an empty string


## [0.0.22]

### Added
- User autodiscovery — bot stores `user_id`, username, and display name for every user seen in approved groups; only writes to DB when profile data changes
- `/users` admin command — paginated list of all known users with a **🏷 Set Tag** button per user; tapping a user starts the setlabel flow directly without needing to forward a message

### Fixed
- Set label flow now works from `/users` selection, bypassing the forward-message limitation that blocked tag assignment when bot permissions denied reading user data from forwards


## [0.0.21]

### Fixed
- Set label flow — forwarding a new user message in DM now always restarts the flow, even when a previous session is stuck at the group-selection step


## [0.0.20]

### Fixed
- `/ticket` — removed topic root message guard that incorrectly blocked tickets in groups with a default General topic (where the first message ID equals the thread ID)
- `/addtopic` — group list now reads from DB instead of in-memory cache, so all approved groups are shown regardless of bot restart


## [0.0.19]

### Added
- Message logging — every message (groups + DMs) is appended to a CSV file with columns: timestamp, chat_type, chat_id, chat_title, thread_id, topic_name, user_id, username, first_name, last_name, message_id, text
- Media-only messages logged with placeholders: `[photo]`, `[video]`, `[document]`, `[sticker]`, etc.
- `/export` admin DM command — sends the current CSV as a file attachment, then resets the log
- `MESSAGES_CSV` env var — path for the message log file (default: `messages.csv`)


## [0.0.18]

### Added
- `/categories` admin command — lists all categories with their current scope (global / group / topic); tap any category to change scope or delete it
- Category detail view: Make Global, Group-level, Topic-level, Delete — all inline, no extra messages


## [0.0.17]

### Removed
- `/granttags` command — bot cannot promote itself; manage permissions manually in group settings

### Changed
- README updated: setup instructions, bot permission requirements, member tag flow documented


## [0.0.16]

### Added
- `/granttags` admin command — promotes the bot with `can_manage_tags` permission in the current group (requires "Add New Admins" enabled temporarily)


## [0.0.15]

### Fixed
- Added debug logging to set label flow to trace failures after label input


## [0.0.14]

### Fixed
- Set label flow now shows only approved groups from DB instead of in-memory cache


## [0.0.13]

### Added
- Group approval system — bot auto-registers groups on first message, only works in approved groups
- `/groups` admin command — lists all known groups with approve/disapprove inline buttons, updated in place

### Removed
- `ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` env var — replaced by DB-driven group approval


## [0.0.12]

### Added
- Set Telegram member tag flow: admin forwards a user message to bot in DM → types label (1–16 chars) → selects group → tag set via `setChatMemberTag` (Bot API 9.5)

## [0.0.11]

### Added
- `/setlabel @username <label>` admin command — assigns a display label to a user in the group chat


## [0.0.10]

### Added
- `/ticket` — Added extra metadata in summary and added description.

## [0.0.9]

### Fixed
- `/ticket` — rejects usage when user replies to topic header instead of a real message, with a clear error

## [0.0.8]

### Fixed
- `/ticket` — reporter correctly taken from `replied.From` (person who posted in the group, not forward origin)
- Telegram message links now include thread ID for topic messages (`/c/CHATID/THREADID/MSGID`)

### Added
- Extended `/ticket` debug logging — logs replied message ID, sender, forward status and origin

## [0.0.7]

### Fixed
- `/ticket` — forwarded messages now correctly detect the original sender instead of the forwarder

### Added
- Cancel button (`❌ Cancel`) on category and request type selection keyboards — cancels the flow in-place without sending extra messages

## [0.0.6]

- Fixing github link in `/version` command response

## [0.0.5]

### Added
- `/version` command — shows current bot version and repository link
- Version injected at build time via `-ldflags` from Docker build arg

## [0.0.4]

### Added
- Docker Compose file for running bot from image
- Log rotation limit: 15 MB per file, 3 files max

### Changed
- `/ticket` — now requires replying to a message instead of pasting a link; reporter name and username captured automatically
- Reporter's Telegram account included in Linear issue description for both `/support` and `/ticket`
- CI Docker image tagged as `VERSION-BRANCHNAME` instead of `snapshot`

## [0.0.3]

### Added
- **`/ticket` flow mode** — prompts for the message link interactively instead of requiring it as a command argument
- **`/addtopic` guided flow** — group selection → topic name → topic ID
- **`/topics` and `/rotation` restricted to admins**
- **Auto-create Linear labels** — category and request type labels created in Linear automatically if missing
- **Both category and type applied as Linear labels**
- **Session TTL reaper** — background goroutine evicts abandoned sessions after 30 minutes
- **DB indexes** on `categories`, `support_assignments`, `category_request_types`, `group_topics`

### Changed
- Migration system replaced with `golang-migrate/migrate` — versioned `*.up.sql` files, no custom code
- `/ticket` stores Telegram message link as-is
- `/topics` aggregates all known groups, works correctly from DMs
- `/addcategory` from DM correctly stores target group `chat_id`
- Command registry is single source of truth for routing, help text, and admin-only enforcement
- Help menu shows admin commands only to admins; unauthorized calls blocked at dispatch level

### Fixed
- Linear label GraphQL query used wrong field name (`labels` → `issueLabels`)
- Request type name was empty in created Linear issues
- Threaded Telegram message links (`/c/CHATID/THREADID/MSGID`) parsed incorrectly
